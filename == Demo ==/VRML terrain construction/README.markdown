## VRML Terrain construction

This demo visualizes the construction of a 3D terrain using the Delaunay triangulation of point projections onto the two dimensional plane. As the tool of visulatization, <a href="http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/vrml/">VRML</a> is used.

## Required software

To play the demo, you need to have a VRML player. The player can be installed either as a browser plugin or as a special tool. Among different VRML player implementations the <a href="http://www.instantreality.org/downloads/">Instant reality</a> tool is the latest and the most developing one.

## Important notes

<em><b>NB:</b> Worked for me correctly for some reason (Instant reality is not a stable tool yet) only after placing this folder to the root of disk C ("C:\").</em>
